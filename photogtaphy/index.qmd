title: "Hobbies and Interests"
---

Beyond academic and research work, I enjoy finding new hobbies. Since little I have loved reading, and lately I have acquired more interest in non-fiction books. Encouraged by a friend, this year I started taking photos with a Kodak Ektar H35 film camera and I have enjoyed it so much! While I wouldn't count it as a hobby, I am a very picky eater and I am in love with yummy food. So I usually spend big chunks of my days cooking meals. I will take advantage of this space to show off some of my best recipes!
