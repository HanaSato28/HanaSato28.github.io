Thank you for passing by my webpage!\nI am Hana Sato, a third year undergraduate student at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) in Ohio, USA. I am a biochemistry B.S. and political science B.A. candidate. For my biochemistry degree, I have concentrations in infectious diseases and structural and computational biochemistry. For my political science degree, while not a school-official concentration, I have placed emphasis on taking courses about international politics.\nBeyond my school courses, I have also been engaged with research. From my first semester at CWRU until my third semester I worked as an undergraduate researcher under the supervision of Dr. Jill Yang, then a post-doctoral fellow in the CWRU Social Justice Institute. And starting from my fourth semester at CWRU, I started working as a researcher in the Lewin Lab, a microbiology lab. I greatly enjoy asking big questions and actively work hard to answer them. Because of this, I am interested in applying to graduate school programs to ultimately obtain a PhD degree. My interests lie on global health and epidemiology, where I will be able to participate in both wet lab experiments as well as computational analyses.\nOutside of academics and research, I enjoy film photography, spending time in nature and helping people to learn Japanese and/or Spanish! Having Japanese heritage while being born and raised in Guatemala, I value cultural diversity and awareness. I often find myself wanting to share about my cultural heritage as well as listen to other people’s cultural backgrounds.\nAgain, thank you so much for visiting my webpage!\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or simply would like to chat with me!"

While I wouldn’t count it as a hobby, I am a very picky eater and I am in love with yummy food. So I usually spend big chunks of my days cooking meals.
